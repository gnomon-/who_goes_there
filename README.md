Intro
------
Who Goes There? is a novella by John W. Campbell (as Don A. Stuart) published in 1938 in Astounding Science-Fiction.

As far as I know, this text is in the public domain and has an expired copyright. The creation of this digital version is solely to provide a formatted version that is enjoyable to read on screen, e-readers, or paper with no desire for financial profit of any kind.

These elctronic versions where typeset by me, Sean M. Anderson. The primary source was Dr. Rearick's hypertext version of the original, located [here][http://nzr.mvnu.edu/faculty/trearick/english/rearick/readings/manuscri/Who%20Goes%20There/Who%20Goes%20There%20Index.htm]. Apparently his primary source was the Internet Archive full text version found [here][http://www.archive.org/stream/WhoGoesThere_414/WhoGoesThere.txt]. Both were checked for consistency and compared to excerpts from a limited online version of The Antarktos Cycle, by Robert M. Price.

Source

There are several different filetypes for the book:
* Plaintext
* Markdown
* XeLaTex source file with PDFs
* EPUB

Compiling the LaTeX file requires XeLaTeX and a few free fonts -- [Linux Libertine][http://www.linuxlibertine.org/] and [Audimat][http://www.smeltery.net/fonts/audimat]. You can compile the document with regular pdflatex if you do not wish to use custom fonts. The TeX file can produce both PDF versions -- for print and for screens.

The EPUB version was created from the markdown file with Ulysses III. You should be able to produce your own EPUB or Mobi file using any similar tool.
